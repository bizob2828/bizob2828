<hr>
<p>My name is Bob.  I'm married with 2 kids, one daughter and one son.  I'm a principal software engineer for an application security startup in Baltimore, MD 🦀.  I've been working at both software companies and web consulting companies since 2005.  I started my career in QA but after 8 years I was was done with writing code to test code. I wanted to actually ship software that people used. I've held positions as invidual contributors as well as middle management.  I love live music and enjoy attending bluegrass music festivals.</p>
